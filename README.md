# Zeep  - XSD/WSDL client code generator for Rust

Generate yaserde annotated structs for Rust based on XSD/WSDL. For WSDL input, client code is generated as well.

The generated code depends on yaserde (0.8) and yaserde_derive for the XSD-generated types. The SOAP client needs tokio, log and reqwest in addition. 
The generated code does *not* have any dependencies on this library.

Check the examples and the Cargo.toml for a complete list of dependencies.

## Installation

```shell
$ cargo install --git https://github.com/mibes404/zeep zeep
```

## Usage

```shell script
USAGE:
    zeep [OPTIONS] --input <from_file> --path <path>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -d, --dns <dns>            Default namespace (URL)
    -i, --input <from_file>    Input from XSD/WSDL file
    -n, --ns <ns>              Namespace prefix
    -p, --path <path>          Base path for the XSD file(s)
    -o, --output <to_file>     Output to file
```

Example usage:

### Output to stdout:
```bash
zeep -p resources/aic -i agent_wsdl.xml
```

### Output to file:
```bash
zeep -p resources/hello -i hello.wsdl -o examples/hello/hello.rs
```

### Format the output
```bash
rustfmt --color=always --edition=2018 examples/hello/hello.rs
```

### Define a default namespace:
No prefixes will be generated for elements matching the default namespace.

```bash
zeep -p resources/hello -i hello.wsdl -o examples/hello/hello.rs -d "http://learnwebservices.com/services/hello"
```

### Define a different prefix:
Use a different prefix than "tns" for the types in the default namespace.

```bash
zeep -p resources/hello -i hello.wsdl -o examples/hello/hello.rs -n ns1
```

## TODO

* [x] Remove the dependency on customized yaserde version, once the renaming of a vector of structs is fixed
* [x] Allow network imports 
* [ ] Enable cargo install
